V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.

  

V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser
from Google.

  

V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition, and runs on
Windows (XP or newer), Mac OS X (10.5 or newer), and Linux systems that use
IA-32 (SSE2 required), x64, ARM (ARMv6 + VFP2 required) or MIPS processors.

  

V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

  

You can find more information here:

  * The V8 documentation page which includes instructions on downloading and building V8.
  * Performance documentation covering the performance goals of V8, and instructions on how to run the Octane benchmark suite (evolution of the V8 benchmark suite).
